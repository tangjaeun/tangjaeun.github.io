# My IO Page

Hello and welcome to my IO page. I usually prefer to code in the afternoons or at night. Although normally, this depends on when I'm awake, as I'm not much of an early riser. Whenever I code, I like to add a lot of comments, so if I ever go back into the code, I can remember what everything does. It's easy for me to forget how things work since coding isn't one of my strong suits. Something that I especially enjoy in coding is working on the front-end side of applications! Whether it's coding in HTML or CSS, or creating the designs to code later.
